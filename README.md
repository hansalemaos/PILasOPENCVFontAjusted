Forked from [GitHub - bunkahle/PILasOPENCV: Wrapper for Image functions which are called like in the PIL module but work internally with OpenCV](https://github.com/bunkahle/PILasOPENCV)



Awesome tool! I really recommend it, but I had some problems with some fonts as you can see on the first picture.

I changed the code a little (getmask(text, ttf_font))  to solve the problem
